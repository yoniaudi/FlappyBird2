# FlappyBird2
Final Project - Flappy Bird 2 - C#.
This is our final project for the first year of computer science, developed using object-oriented programming and Windows Forms with C#.
Together with my friend Mor Moshe, we worked on this project as our final assignment.
Our aim was to create a fully functional game within a limited timeframe, incorporating animation, sound, a scoring system, and save/load functionality.
We thoroughly enjoyed the process of working on this project and gained valuable knowledge and experience along the way.
