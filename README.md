# FlappyBird2
Final Project - Flappy Bird 2 - C#.
This is our final project for the first year of computer science, developed using object-oriented programming and Windows Forms with C#.
Together with my friend Mor Moshe, we worked on this project as our final assignment.
Our aim was to create a fully functional game within a limited timeframe, incorporating animation, sound, a scoring system, and save/load functionality.
We thoroughly enjoyed the process of working on this project and gained valuable knowledge and experience along the way.

Requirements for the final project:
The project should include a complex hierarchical system of classes, with no less than the following structure:

       Base
      ^    ^
    D1      D2
   ^  ^
 D11  D12

Note: The Base class is not derived from C# or any other predefined package.

Management of the classes should be done using Polymorphism.
Organization of objects should be done using a Collection object.
Ability to add, modify, and delete objects.
Event-driven programming based on the techniques learned.
Visual representation of objects.
Saving the current state of the object system, with the option to restore it using a Serialization mechanism.
